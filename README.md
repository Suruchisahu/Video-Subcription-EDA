## MavenFlix Subscription Analysis

This repository contains Python code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a subscription cohort analysis dataset for MavenFlix. 

### Functionality

The code performs the following analysis:

* **Initial Data Exploration:** Provides basic information about data types, presence of missing values, and unique values in each column.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and prepares the data for analysis.
* **Customer Retention:** Analyzes subscriber retention rates, including:
    * Percentage of customers subscribed for 5 months or more.
    * Retention rate by month of subscription (highest and lowest months).
* **Subscription Trends:** Visualizes the trend of monthly subscriptions over a specified time period (2022-2024 by default).

### Code Structure

The code is a Python script utilizing libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

* **Data Loading:** Reads the CSV file named "Subscription Cohort Analysis Data.csv" into a pandas dataframe.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and prepares the data for analysis.
* **Analysis Functions:**
    * `calculate_retention_over_5_months(data)`: Calculates the percentage of customers subscribed for 5 months or more.
    * `find_highest_lowest_retention_months(data)`: Identifies the month with the highest and lowest subscriber retention rate.
    * `plot_monthly_subscription_trend(data)`: Generates a line plot visualizing the trend of monthly subscriptions.
* **Main Script:** Orchestrates the data loading, cleaning, analysis functions, and visualization.

### Dependencies

The code requires the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Ensure you have the "Subscription Cohort Analysis Data.csv" file in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script using `python eda.py` (assuming the script is named eda.py).

The script will generate output including:

* Descriptive statistics about the data.
* Percentage of customers subscribed for 5 months or more.
* Month with the highest and lowest subscriber retention rate.
* A line plot visualizing the trend of monthly subscriptions from 2022 to 2024.
